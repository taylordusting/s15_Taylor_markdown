### Bold, Italics, and Strikethrough
These can be accomplished by wrapping a section of a paragraph in either asterisks, underscores or tildes.

```
Italics can be done like *this* or _this_.
Bold can be done like **this** or __this__.
You can also combine bold and italics like **_this_**.
Strikethrough is done with a double tilde like ~~this~~.
```

### Lists
Lists are created in two ways: ordered, and unordered.
```
An unordered list uses asterisks like this:
* I want to make
* an unordered list
* using asterisks

An ordered list is created using numbers:
1. This list is
2. an ordered list
3. because there are numbers
